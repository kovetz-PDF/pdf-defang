Strip JavaScript, OpenAction, Launch actions and other active content
from PDFs. Lightweight Python library on top of pikepdf.

Quick start::

    from pdf_defang import sanitize, scan

    # Clean a file in place
    sanitize("uploaded.pdf")

    # Inspect without modifying
    report = scan("suspicious.pdf")
    print(report.risk_level)  # 'high' / 'medium' / 'low' / 'none'
