## Why?

PDFs can carry executable content: JavaScript that runs when the file
opens, auto-actions that fire on every page navigation, "Launch" actions
that try to open other programs, embedded files that drop malware. If you
process user-uploaded PDFs in your app, you should strip this content
before serving them back.

The Python ecosystem has parsers (`pikepdf`, `pypdf`, `PyMuPDF`) and a
heavy container-based tool ([Dangerzone](https://dangerzone.rocks/)), but
no clean drop-in library that says "give me this PDF without active
content."

This is that library.

## Install

```bash
pip install pdf-defang
```

Requires Python 3.9+ and pikepdf 8+.

## Three ways to use it

=== "Python API"

    ```python
    from pdf_defang import sanitize, scan

    # Clean a file in place
    sanitize("uploaded.pdf")

    # Inspect without modifying
    report = scan("suspicious.pdf")
    print(report.risk_level)  # 'high' / 'medium' / 'low' / 'none'
    ```

=== "Async API"

    ```python
    from pdf_defang import sanitize_async

    async def handle_upload(path):
        report = await sanitize_async(path, return_report=True)
        return report.as_dict()
    ```

=== "Bytes API"

    ```python
    from pdf_defang import sanitize_bytes

    raw = await uploaded_file.read()
    cleaned = sanitize_bytes(raw)
    # 'cleaned' is the sanitized PDF as bytes - no disk involved
    ```

=== "Command line"

    ```bash
    pdf-defang clean uploaded.pdf
    pdf-defang scan suspicious.pdf --json
    pdf-defang clean *.pdf  # batch
    ```

## Two levels: strict (default) vs balanced

```python
sanitize("untrusted.pdf")                       # level="strict" - safest
sanitize("internal_form.pdf", level="balanced") # keep form interactivity
```

Both levels strip the same attack vectors (JavaScript at document level,
`/Launch`, `/GoToR`, dangerous URI schemes, etc.). `balanced` keeps
form-related actions (`/SubmitForm`, `/ResetForm`, form JS, calculate
triggers) and embedded files alive when you trust the source. See
[Protections](protections.md) for the full matrix.

## What gets removed

A complete reference is on the [Protections page](protections.md). The
short list (everything below is stripped in both levels unless noted):

- Document-level **JavaScript**
- **OpenAction** and document **/AA** auto-execute actions
- **Launch**, **GoToR**, **GoToE**, **ImportData**, **Rendition**,
  **Movie**, **Sound** annotation actions
- Page-level **/AA**
- **XFA forms** (legacy attack surface)
- Dangerous **URI** schemes (`javascript:`, `file:`, `data:`, UNC paths)
- Strict-only: annotation **JavaScript / SubmitForm / ResetForm**,
  annotation `/AA` and `/JS`, AcroForm `/CO`, embedded files

What stays:

- All visible text, images, layout
- Standard form fields and their values
- Safe hyperlinks (`http`, `https`, `mailto`, `tel`, `ftp`)
- Bookmarks, table of contents, metadata, encryption
